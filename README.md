# PerCov Dataset

The PerCov dataset was gathered with the purpose of constructing a diagnostic system for COVID-19. Given the scarcity of datasets in the Persian language, this particular collection was made utilizing the Persian language for its audio recordings, including sounds of breathing, coughing, vowels, and speech.

## Description

The raw audio data collected is stored in this GitHub repository. The nine sound samples contributed by each participant consist of the following:
1) Sustained vowel /aaa/, 
2) Sustained vowel /eee/, 
3) Sustained vowel /ooo/,
4) Shallow coughs, 
5) Deep coughs, 
6) Shallow breathing,
7) Deep breathing,
8) Slow counting of numbers one to ten,
9) Fast counting of numbers one to ten.

## Metadata

The collected metadata information encompasses the participant's demographics, such as age and gender, as well as data on symptoms, vaccination status, diagnostic test results, prior respiratory illnesses, and current overall health condition.
